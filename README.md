🌌 QuantumAI Pro – Advanced Quantum Simulator
QuantumAI Pro is a next-generation, interactive quantum simulation platform that brings complex quantum mechanics to life. Powered by PyQt5, NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib, this tool is built for students, educators, and researchers seeking deep insights into quantum systems—without sacrificing usability or power.

🚀 Features
🧠 Real-Time Quantum Simulation
Simulate particles in various quantum potentials: harmonic oscillators, quantum wells, double slits, tunneling barriers, and more.

🌊 Dynamic Wavefunction Visualization
View real-time evolution of both position and momentum space wavefunctions.

🎯 Measurement & Expectation Tracking
Track expectation values, uncertainties (Δx, Δp), and validate Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle dynamically.

🪄 Interactive Entanglement & Qubits
Simulate multi-particle entanglement, visualize quantum gates (X, H), and see qubit states on a 3D Bloch Sphere.

🔬 Deep Analysis Tools
Analyze phase space, energy components, and time evolution across intuitive graphs.

🎨 Modern UI with Theming & Customization
Switch between light, dark, or custom themes; rearrange your simulation lab with drag-and-drop panels.

📈 Export & Report
Export simulation data and plots instantly for papers, presentations, or further analysis.

📚 Built-In Interactive Tutorial
Learn quantum principles through a step-by-step, animated, metaphor-rich walkthrough.
